🔍 What Vizier Actually Is (For Context)
Google Vizier is a black-box hyperparameter optimization service. Its core primitives are:

Your friend integrated a vizier_stub.py — a simplified local implementation of these primitives that doesn't need the full Vizier server — and this stub has a critical Python bug that crashes any code that uses it.
